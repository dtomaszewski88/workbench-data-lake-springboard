"""
Sample script that can run either directly in the workbench or as a job in a cluster.

It shows how you can export data in a custom format.

It extracts the time and price of each trade for 4 products (AAPL, TSLA, IBM, F) of the previous day,
and stores the data in the filesystem shared between the workbench instance and the clusters.

The export format is one CSV file for each product/day combination.
